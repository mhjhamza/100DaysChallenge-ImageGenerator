# 100DaysChallenge-ImageGenerator

I've seen many people in close circle following 100DaysChallenges. 

However, generating an image to post on daily basis is a pain!

I came-up with this idea to create a handy utility for all the "doers" who've pledged for any kind of 100 Days Challenge - Be it Health, Fitness, Code or even reading books. This utility allows the users to choose (or upload) from a variety of image backgrounds, and choose a border style and then let's then post the image (along with the description of their milestones for a particular day) on linked social media accounts with a single click.

It's a prototype, just to show how the utility should work.

**Here are some statistics: **

> Buzzsumo found that posts with images receive 2.3 times more engagement than those without. If a relevant image is paired with that same information, people retained 65% of the information three days later. 32% of marketers say visual images are the most important form of content for their business.


Feel free to contribute - please create a pull request if the projects seems interesting.

**Below are some example images generated by the utility.**
