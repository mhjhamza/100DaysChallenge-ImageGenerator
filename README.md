# 100DaysChallenge-ImageGenerator
A handy utility for all the doers who've pledged for any kind of 100 Days Challenge - Be it Health, Fitness, Code or even reading books. This utility allows the users to choose (or upload) from a variety of image backgrounds, and choose a border still and then let's then post the image (along with the description of their milestones for a particular day) on linked social media accounts with a single click.
